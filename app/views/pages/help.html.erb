resources 
	
	resources are simply any external item such as video or audio file related to irish music which you want 
	to save either as a link. links to video or audio files can then be clicked on and will play. in the case
	of sheetmusic jpg/gif files can be uploaded.

groups
	Groups are any grouping of other items such as tunes, sets, or resources. One purpose might be to 
	assemble some list of tunes to practice. Or to then make those into sets. Or to put some list of 
	resources such as youtube clips together as a playlist.
	
	A group can be "archived" which means it becomes locked (cannot add or remove items) and will not show up on 
	the groups page unless the "show archived" option is clicked. This is so as to remove clutter if you want
	to keep say a lists of things around but out of the way.
